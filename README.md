# 3rd-Challenge-Password-Generator

## What Motivated me and what was my objectives?

In this challenge i was tasked with writing the javascript function in order to make this password generator work smoothly and correctly. I can happily say that i have sucessfully achieved this task by ensuring that when the generate password button is clicked that the user is presented with a series of prompts that help them select what criteria they want to choose in the password.

I have also ensured that when the user is prompted for the length of the password that it is no less than 8 characters and no more than 128 characters. In addition i have also made it clear that at least one character type should be selected when generating the random password on this application.

Finally i have made sure that once the application has ran through the functions on the javascript file that the password is then displayed on the page for the user to use.
